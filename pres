	- Eye Tracking Gameplay

	- Head tracking gampley

* Eye Tracking Main Idea

	RealSense creates Landmarks from the face

	Creation of virtual point from landmarks

	Calculation of the distance between the virtual point and the eye

* Head Tracking Main Idea

	RealSense calculates Position Angle of the face

	Pitch is the Vertical angle

	Yaw is the Horizental angle

	ROLL is the degree of rotation of the head

* About the SDK

	Javascript SDK

	after initialisation of the sdk, server sends events to "onFaceData"

	it sends several objects

	we use data.faces to get the first detected faces

	*note that the landmarks work only on the first detected face


* About the SDK

	face object data depend on the initialization part (refers to the intel documentation)

	landmarks : face.landmarks.landmarksPoints[XX]

	XX is the number of landmarks you want to use

	it contains X and Y

	Head tracking angle:

	face.pose.poseAngles

	it contains Pitch // Roll // Yaw

* Eye tracking calibration

	caliration of the eye postion in function of the screen

	3 points to look

	Eye position transform in percentage from the calibration

	moving the pad depending of the percentage

* Head Tracking

	arbitrary calibration set to -15 15

	Yaw data is transform in percentage from the arbitrary calibration

	moving the pad depending of the percentage


* That's it !
