	- Eye Tracking Gameplay

	- Head tracking gampley

* Eye Tracking Main principle

	RealSense create Landmark from the face

	Creation of a virtual point from the landmarks

	Calculation of the distance between the virtual point and the eye

* Head Tracking Main principle

	RealSense calculate Position Angle of the face

	Pitch is the UP-DOWN angle

	Yaw is the LEFT-RIGHT angle

	ROLL is the rotation angle of the face

* About the SDK

	Javascript SDK

	after initialisation the sdk server send event to "onFaceData"

	its send several object

	we use data.faces to get the first detected faces

	*note that the landmarks work only on the first detected face


* About the SDK

	face object data depend of the initalistaion part (refers to the intel documentation)

	landmarks : face.landmarks.landmarksPoints[XX]

	XX is the number of the landmarks you want to use

	it contain X and Y

	Head tracking angle:

	face.pose.poseAngles

	it contain Pitch Roll Yaw

* Eye tracking calibration

	caliration of the eye postion in fonction of the screen

	3 point to look

	Eye position transform in percentage from the calibration

	moving the pad depending of the percentage

* Head Tracking

	arbitrary calibration set to -15 15

	Yaw data is transform in percentage from the arbitrary calibration

	moving the pad depending of the percentage


* That's it !
